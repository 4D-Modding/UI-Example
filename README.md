# UI-Example
 example that shows how to add custom UI to your mod.
 in this example it adds ui `Interface` for Player hud render.
 and puts some ui elements into it like `Text` and `Image`.

 it also uses custom asset for the image. (`someTex.png` which it loads from `.\mods\Custom-UI\someTex.png`)
